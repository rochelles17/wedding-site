<p> When Karen Smith founded Karen Smith Weddings, she had one mission in mind – to help other couples easily navigate every wedding planning detail, both big and small. After all, she learned these lessons the hard way planning her own wedding. Combine a whirlwind engagement, an unfamiliar city and an interracial couple and forget it – there was simply no resource with the insight she needed to help her plan.</p>

<p>Even though her wedding was a blast, Karen realized better resources would have made planning her nuptials a lot less stressful. So she vowed to make wedding planning easy and fun for everyone else. For nearly 20 years I’ve helped hundreds of couples plan amazing, memorable weddings. You’re next!</p>
